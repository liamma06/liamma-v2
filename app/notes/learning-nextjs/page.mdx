# Learning Next.js

<div className="text-xs text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 mb-6 font-mono">January 28, 2025</div>

My journey into the world of Next.js and React development.

## Key Concepts

### App Router
The new App Router in Next.js 13+ is a game changer:
- File-based routing
- Layouts and nested routes
- Server and client components

### Server Components
Server components run on the server and can:
- Fetch data directly
- Reduce bundle size
- Improve performance

## What I Built

1. **Portfolio Website**: This very site you're reading!
2. **Dynamic Routing**: Notes system with MDX
3. **Theme Switching**: Dark/light mode support
