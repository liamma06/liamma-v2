# Summer 2025

<div className="text-xs text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 mb-6 font-mono">September 9, 2025</div>

With Summer 25 coming to an End... Let's see what I actually accomplished !

**TL;DR-my goals were from my last note were:**
- Consistent coding/learning
- Building projects
- Push myself outside of classroom & comfort zone


There's this saying something along the lines of, "the grass is greener on the other side." And I can't help but feel it. There's always that nagging thought: you could've always done more. Maybe I shouldn't have scrolled so many reel that day, maybe I could've slept earlier that night, or maybe I should've skipped that one meeting and focused on something else. 

During my 2 months in Hong Kong my Gozhe (idk if I spelled that correctly), dad's younger sister, would always ask me, "Do you remember when you were little, we used to hold hands while hiking on the mountain?" And I would say no. She then jokingly say "heartless". It's strange how reflecting back it is so much easier to remember the negatives like the time I wouldn't get up the floor in some mall when walking with her. 

Maybe I didn't do everything I could've but it is still improtant to recognize what I did get done, if that makes any sense.🤨

## Learning & Projects

Before HK I was grinding everyday and completed 5 or so project(some failures). Looking back going from basic HTML/CSS/JS to working with Next, Python, GO, APIs, and etc. For once, I actaully feel like I know the direction I need to take when building a project - and that's so relieving.

However in HK the pace slowed down ... SURPIRSE I had a job at KPMG as a tax intern. That meant after work was the only time to build. However I also wanted to spend time with family so I initally had a hard time balancing. By the end I started coding more but at the cost of sleep. Which was honestly a plus-plus situation my grandma sleeps at 4 AM so I just spend time iwth her while coding late. Downside: 4 hours of sleep going into my job.🫥

**Still lots to learn**

## Pushing Comfort zone

This was trickier - it's not like you can do this inside your home. But KPMG helped. Being around interns meant dinners, parties, networking, and me… being awkward. I probably didn’t make the best impression every time, but at least I showed up.

I also tried apply to be bot ha Peer Leader and Student Ambassador for engineering. Got Peer Leader( huge plus) but not Ambassador for sure wished for both. During my interview I wasn't the most prepared and honestly a bit controversial😂. When asked about time management and balance, I said: “Balance is a myth. You just sacrifice depending on priorities.” …maybe not the answer they wanted.

Oh, I posted my first reel. This honestly might be the most uncomfortable I have ever felt posting it. I editing and filmed for almost a month and couldn't get myself to post it. I planned to post it before heading on the plane back to Canada. So I did it and I was so nervous I was literally light headed💀. Haven’t checked the account in 3 days because I’m still too scared 😂. But hey — big comfort zone push.

## Grandparents ...

I was so focus on learning, building, and pushing myself however looking back there was a hidden quest: spending time with Grandparents

I lived with my grandma and she always bugged me: staying out too late, drinking cold water, stop chewing gum, etc. Of course sometimes it could be unreasonable and felt frustrated but it's just because she cares too much.

She always reminded me to listen to parents, and don't forget them. And yeah, there are generational gaps - like her wanted me to get a wife and have kids ASAP 😭. But she just cares a lot.

I just want her to know I’ll be alright. She did a good job raising us, and she doesn’t need to stress so much anymore. She really did well. (Might not be having kids anytime soon tho 😂)

## future
- Keep posting reels (hopefully not as nervous next time)
- continue building projects and learning
- Maybe gf and kids 😂

Let's do this for grannie and grandpa
